### Tweaks Synopsis

From my understanding of the character, Navarre is a highly oppressive character with Large amounts of potential for Mixups and Extensions using Side Special.
His frame data, attributes and damage output seems to indicate that as a sword fighter, navarre is meant to be solely focused on live reactionary punishes. Ones that decimate opponents in rapid speed as he applies a bit of pressure through tight spacing and movement. Something that other characters in his franchise seem to only do partially. 
Despite this, Navarre sometimes feels as though something is missing within his Kit to make him feel completely unique in how he handles opponents. As well as a glaring issue in terms of how Navarre functions.
Two problems I look to tackle personally here.

- Navarre's Attack Hitboxes and Range. Navarre has a a large sword, and a significantly smaller dagger. Both of these tools are disjointed quite a bit, as surprisingly active. This can lead to characters being hit in positions where it does not seem correct.
This affects game feel rather extensively for both Navarre and his opponent. I'd like to retract some of that disjoint to promote a closer game of combat during gameplay. As well as provide a bit of leighway toward the opponent. Allowing for closer punishes even if by a short bit.

- Navarre's Movement Options. Not specifically his attributes, but his movement when using Side Special. On the ground and the Air the Special can feel a little stiff, more notably in the Air. Causing a bit of clunkiness when using this variant of the move 
specifically. I'd like to free up that clunkiness in the air, but also allow for more alterations on the ground that aid in navarre's potent mixup potential as well as giving him a tool or two that helps him stand out a bit more amongst the cast of characters in his type.

The content presented may change in the future. The changelog will also update when this is the case.
Hopefully these changes are something that can be enjoyed by all who like playing Navarre, as well as those who may have an interest in him.
With these changes, I hope to make Navarre a more interesting character who thrives on spacial awareness and movement mixups. While also rewarding precisely timed extensions and setups. As well as making him a bit more interesting to fight as well, as a core problem he does have as a moveset addition to me, seems to be his lack of variety in how he plays as well as how he is played against.
